*DESCRIPTION*:

This task focuses on performing basic file operations in the C programming language. The goal is to write a program that can:


1. Create a file – This involves generating a new file if it doesn’t already exist or overwriting an existing one.


2. Write data to the file – The program should allow users to enter some text and store it in the file.


3. Read data from the file – It should be able to read the contents of the file and display them to the user.


4. Append data to the file – Additional data should be added to the end of the file without overwriting the existing contents.


Through this program, I am demonstrating how to use various file modes in C such as "w" (write), "r" (read), and "a" (append). This task helps in understanding how to work with files in C, which is a fundamental concept for handling data storage in programs.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char filename[100];
    char data[500];

    printf("Enter the filename: ");
    scanf("%s", filename);

    // Create and write to file
    FILE *fptr = fopen(filename, "w");
    if (fptr == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file for writing!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter data to write into the file: ");
    getchar(); // to consume leftover newline
    fgets(data, sizeof(data), stdin);
    fputs(data, fptr);
    fclose(fptr);
    printf("Data written successfully.\n");

    // Append to file
    fptr = fopen(filename, "a");
    if (fptr == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file for appending!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter data to append to the file: ");
    fgets(data, sizeof(data), stdin);
    fputs(data, fptr);
    fclose(fptr);
    printf("Data appended successfully.\n");

    // Read and display file contents
    fptr = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (fptr == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file for reading!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("\nContents of the file '%s':\n", filename);
    while (fgets(data, sizeof(data), fptr) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", data);
    }
    fclose(fptr);

    return 0;
}
